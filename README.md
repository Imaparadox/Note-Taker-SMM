# Note-Taker-SMM

This project is a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.

## Description
When the user opens the Note Taker in browser, they are presented with a landing page with a link to the notes page. The link will bring the user to the actual note page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, in addition to fields in which a user can enter a note to the right-hand column. If a new note title and note text is entered, then a save icon will appear in the navigation bar. 

When the user clicks the save icon, the new note entered is saved and appears in the left hand column with other existing notes
